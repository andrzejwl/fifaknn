## Set FIFA 20 player overall rating using the KNN algorithm
___
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a modified version of [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset).
___
### Functionality
Based on existing players we might want to establish what overall rating a new player would have without knowing the empirical formula. I used the *K Nearest Neighbours* algorithm to do that, which has turned out to be pretty accurate (~.95 accuracy).
